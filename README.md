# Assembly: Basic Knowledge on Registers

This document provides a beginner-friendly explanation of registers in assembly language, focusing on the x86-64 architecture. It includes an overview of register types, usage, and examples to help you get started.

---

### (1) **What Are Registers?**

Registers are high-speed storage areas within the CPU. They are used to perform arithmetic operations, store temporary data, and handle memory addresses. In x86-64 assembly, registers are named based on their roles and sizes.

---

### (2) **Register Types and Sizes**

Each register can be accessed in different sizes:
- **64-bit registers**: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, etc. (full 64-bit usage)
- **32-bit registers**: `eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, etc. (lower 32 bits of the 64-bit register)
- **16-bit registers**: `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, etc. (lower 16 bits of the 64-bit register)
- **8-bit registers**: `al`, `ah` (lower 8 bits or higher 8 bits of the lower 16 bits)

For example:
- `rax` â†’ Full 64-bit register.
- `eax` â†’ Lower 32 bits of `rax`.
- `ax` â†’ Lower 16 bits of `rax`.
- `al` â†’ Lower 8 bits of `rax`.
- `ah` â†’ Upper 8 bits of `ax`.

### (4) **Basic Register Operations**

#### Moving Data
```asm
mov rax, 5          ; Load 5 into rax
mov rbx, rax        ; Copy rax value to rbx
mov [rsp], rax      ; Store rax value in memory at rsp
mov rax, [rsp]      ; Load value from memory at rsp to rax
```
#### Arithmetic
```asm
add rax, rbx        ; Add rbx to rax
sub rax, 2          ; Subtract 2 from rax
mul rbx             ; Multiply rax by rbx
```
#### Conditional Branching
```asm
cmp rax, rbx        ; Compare rax and rbx
je equal_label      ; Jump if equal
jg greater_label    ; Jump if greater
```

### (5) **Specialized String Operations**

For string manipulation, specific registers and instructions are used:

- rsi (source) and rdi (destination).
- rcx (counter for iterations).
- cld: Clears the direction flag to process memory forward.

  
##### Example
```asm
cld                 ; Clear direction flag
rep movsb           ; Copy bytes from [rsi] to [rdi]
```


### (6) **Function Call Example**

#### C
```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

#### Assembly
```asm
mov rdi, 5          ; First argument a = 5
mov rsi, 3          ; Second argument b = 3
call add            ; Call the function
; Result is stored in rax
```

### (7) Common Use Cases

#### **Arithmetic and Logic**
- Use `rax` for calculations.
- Use `rdx` as a helper register.

#### **Memory Operations**
- Use `rdi` and `rsi` for source/destination.
- Use `rsp` for stack operations.

#### **Function Calls**
- Follow the calling convention (arguments in `rdi`, `rsi`, etc.).

---

### (8) Additional Tips

#### **Avoid overwriting important registers**
- Save registers with `push` before modifying and restore them with `pop`.

#### **Optimize for clarity**
- Use specific registers for their intended purposes (e.g., `rax` for results).

#### **Test with small programs**
- Practice writing and running assembly code with simple functions like addition or string copying.

---

### (9) Conclusion

Understanding registers is crucial for assembly programming. Familiarize yourself with their roles, calling conventions, and basic operations to write efficient and clear assembly code. Good luck ðŸŽ‰

## Challenges and Failures

> Below is a summary of the issues encountered while implementing the `ft_strcpy` function in assembly, the reasons behind the failures, and the lessons learned from each experience.

#### Original Approach with `lodsb`, `stosb`, and `jne`
What was tried:
> I aimed to simplify memory operations by using `lodsb` to load bytes and `stosb` to store bytes, combined with conditional jumps (`jne`) for null termination checks.


### Original Code:
```asm
section .text
global ft_strcpy

ft_strcpy:
                        ; rdi = dest, rsi = src
    cld                 ; DF = 0 auto inc 1
    mov rax, rdi        ; rax = dest address

.loop:
                        ; rdi = rsi memory address, al = read value from the memory
    lodsb               ; al = *rsi, rsi++
    stosb               ; rdi[0] = p, rdi++
    cmp al, 0           ; if al == '\0', set Zero Flag
    jne .loop           ; if not null terminator, loop
    ret
```


---

### **Issues and Lessons Learned**

#### **Implicit Behavior of `lodsb` and `stosb`**
- The `lodsb` and `stosb` instructions implicitly modify the `rsi` and `rdi` registers by incrementing or decrementing them based on the direction flag (`DF`).
- While this implicit behavior worked fine in isolated tests, it caused conflicts when `ft_strcpy` was called within `ft_strdup`, as these registers needed to remain intact for correct memory operations.

#### **Direction Flag Dependency (`cld`)**
- The `cld` instruction was used to explicitly clear the direction flag (`DF`) to ensure forward memory traversal.
- However, if another function altered the `DF` before calling `ft_strcpy` and failed to reset it, the behavior of `lodsb` and `stosb` became unpredictable.
- This reliance on external factors made `ft_strcpy` fragile and context-dependent in broader programs.

#### **Reduced Debuggability**
- The implicit memory operations of `lodsb` and `stosb` made debugging more difficult, as changes to `rsi` and `rdi` were not directly visible.
- Errors in larger or nested contexts were harder to trace, making the debugging process inefficient and time-consuming.

#### **Register Modifications in Broader Contexts**
- The shared usage of `rsi` and `rdi` between `ft_strcpy` and `ft_strdup` led to unexpected side effects.
- The implicit changes caused by `lodsb` and `stosb` exacerbated these issues, resulting in incorrect copying behavior or memory corruption.

---

### **What I Learned:**  
> This approach, while elegant for small, isolated use cases, introduces implicit behavior that can conflict in larger, nested contexts. Understanding these limitations helped refine my future approaches to be more explicit and robust.

#### **Explicit Behavior is Key**
- Implicit register modifications, while convenient, can introduce hidden dependencies that conflict with other parts of the program.
- Explicitly managing registers and memory operations reduces the risk of unintended side effects and improves maintainability.

#### **Avoid Contextual Fragility**
- Functions should not rely on external conditions (e.g., the state of the direction flag) to operate correctly.
- By designing `ft_strcpy` to be self-contained and independent, it became more robust and reusable.

#### **Clarity Over Complexity**
- While advanced instructions like `lodsb` and `stosb` can simplify code in specific cases, they obscure the logic in more complex, nested scenarios.
- Using straightforward, explicit memory operations improved both readability and reliability.

### Final Code:
```asm
section .text
global ft_strcpy

ft_strcpy:
    mov rax, rdi
    xor rcx, rcx                ; i = 0

.loop:
    mov dh, byte [rsi + rcx]    ; dh = src[i]
    mov byte [rdi + rcx], dh
    inc rcx                     ; i++
    test dh, dh                 ; test dh == '\0'
    jnz .loop                   ; if not null, continue loop

    ret
```
---

### **Key Changes**

1. **Explicit Control**  
   - Replaced `lodsb` and `stosb` with explicit `mov` instructions:  
     - `mov dh, byte [rsi + rcx]` for loading.  
     - `mov byte [rdi + rcx], dh` for storing.  
   - This ensures that `rsi` and `rdi` are not modified unintentionally.

2. **Removed Direction Flag Dependency**  
   - Eliminated the need for `cld` by using explicit address calculations (`rsi + rcx`, `rdi + rcx`).  
   - This makes the function independent of the direction flag, ensuring consistent behavior.

3. **Improved Debuggability**  
   - By explicitly showing all memory operations, the function becomes easier to debug and trace in case of errors.

4. **Register Isolation**  
   - The final code ensures that only `dh` is used for temporary storage, avoiding any modifications to critical registers like `rsi` or `rdi`.

---

### **Conclusion**

- The original code relied on implicit behavior (`lodsb` and `stosb`) and was dependent on the direction flag (`DF`), making it fragile and prone to bugs in nested contexts.  

- The final code resolves these issues by adopting explicit memory operations, removing direction flag dependency, and improving register isolation, resulting in a robust implementation suitable for broader use cases.
