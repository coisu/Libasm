# Assembly: Basic Knowledge on Registers

This document provides a beginner-friendly explanation of registers in assembly language, focusing on the x86-64 architecture. It includes an overview of register types, usage, and examples to help you get started.

---

### 2-1 **What Are Registers?**

Registers are high-speed storage areas within the CPU. They are used to perform arithmetic operations, store temporary data, and handle memory addresses. In x86-64 assembly, registers are named based on their roles and sizes.

---

### 2-2 **Register Types and Sizes**

Each register can be accessed in different sizes:
- **64-bit registers**: `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, etc. (full 64-bit usage)
- **32-bit registers**: `eax`, `ebx`, `ecx`, etc. (lower 32 bits of the 64-bit register)
- **16-bit registers**: `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, etc. (lower 16 bits of the 64-bit register)
- **8-bit registers**: `al`, `ah` (lower 8 bits or higher 8 bits of the lower 16 bits)

For example:
- `rax` â†’ Full 64-bit register.
- `eax` â†’ Lower 32 bits of `rax`.
- `ax` â†’ Lower 16 bits of `rax`.
- `al` â†’ Lower 8 bits of `rax`.
- `ah` â†’ Upper 8 bits of `ax`.

| `CF`  | Carry Flag: Set if thereâ€™s a carry out of the most significant bit |
| `OF`  | Overflow Flag: Set if signed overflow occurs |

---

### 2-4 **Basic Register Operations**

#### Moving Data
```asm
mov rax, 5          ; Load 5 into rax
mov rbx, rax        ; Copy rax value to rbx
mov [rsp], rax      ; Store rax value in memory at rsp
mov rax, [rsp]      ; Load value from memory at rsp to rax
```
#### Arithmetic
```asm
add rax, rbx        ; Add rbx to rax
sub rax, 2          ; Subtract 2 from rax
mul rbx             ; Multiply rax by rbx
```
#### Conditional Branching
```asm
cmp rax, rbx        ; Compare rax and rbx
je equal_label      ; Jump if equal
jg greater_label    ; Jump if greater
```

### 2-5 **Specialized String Operations**

For string manipulation, specific registers and instructions are used:

- rsi (source) and rdi (destination).
- rcx (counter for iterations).
- cld: Clears the direction flag to process memory forward.

  
##### Example
```asm
cld                 ; Clear direction flag
rep movsb           ; Copy bytes from [rsi] to [rdi]
```


### 2-6 **Function Call Example**

#### C
```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

#### Assembly
```asm
mov rdi, 5          ; First argument a = 5
mov rsi, 3          ; Second argument b = 3
call add            ; Call the function
; Result is stored in rax
```

### 2-7 Common Use Cases

#### **Arithmetic and Logic**
- Use `rax` for calculations.
- Use `rdx` as a helper register.

#### **Memory Operations**
- Use `rdi` and `rsi` for source/destination.
- Use `rsp` for stack operations.

#### **Function Calls**
- Follow the calling convention (arguments in `rdi`, `rsi`, etc.).

---

### 2-8 Additional Tips

#### **Avoid overwriting important registers**
- Save registers with `push` before modifying and restore them with `pop`.

#### **Optimize for clarity**
- Use specific registers for their intended purposes (e.g., `rax` for results).

#### **Test with small programs**
- Practice writing and running assembly code with simple functions like addition or string copying.

---

### 2-9 Conclusion

Understanding registers is crucial for assembly programming. Familiarize yourself with their roles, calling conventions, and basic operations to write efficient and clear assembly code. Good luck ðŸŽ‰

## 3. Challenges and Failures
While Implementing ft_strcpy
- Below is a summary of the issues encountered while implementing the ft_strcpy function in assembly, the reasons behind the failures, and the lessons learned from each experience.

### Original Code:
```asm
section .text
global ft_strcpy

ft_strcpy:
                        ; rdi = dest, rsi = src
    cld                 ; DF = 0 auto inc 1
    mov rax, rdi        ; rax = dest address

.loop:
                        ; rdi = rsi memory address, al = read value from the memory
    lodsb               ; al = *rsi, rsi++
    stosb               ; rdi[0] = p, rdi++
    cmp al, 0           ; if al == '\0', set Zero Flag
    jne .loop           ; if not null terminator, loop
    ret
```


---

### **Issues**

1. **Implicit Behavior of `lodsb` and `stosb`**:  
   - Both `lodsb` and `stosb` modify the `rsi` and `rdi` registers implicitly by incrementing or decrementing them depending on the direction flag (`DF`).  
   - While this might work in isolated tests, it introduces potential bugs when `ft_strcpy` is used in a context like `ft_strdup`, where the integrity of `rsi` and `rdi` needs to be preserved for proper memory operations.  

2. **Direction Flag Dependency (`cld`)**:  
   - The direction flag (`DF`) is explicitly cleared with `cld` at the start of the function to ensure forward memory traversal.  
   - If another function sets `DF` before calling `ft_strcpy` but does not reset it, the behavior of `lodsb` and `stosb` becomes unpredictable.  
   - This makes `ft_strcpy` context-dependent and fragile when integrated into a broader program.  

3. **Implicit Logic Reduces Debuggability**:  
   - Since `lodsb` and `stosb` hide the memory operations, debugging becomes challenging as the explicit state of `rsi` and `rdi` is not directly visible.  
   - This leads to errors that are harder to trace back to their source, particularly in larger or nested contexts.  

4. **Register Modifications in Broader Contexts**:  
   - When `ft_strcpy` is called inside `ft_strdup`, modifying `rsi` and `rdi` causes unexpected side effects because these registers are shared between the two functions.  
   - The implicit nature of `lodsb` and `stosb` exacerbates the problem, leading to incorrect copying behavior.  

---


### Final Code:
```asm
section .text
global ft_strcpy

ft_strcpy:
    mov rax, rdi
    xor rcx, rcx                ; i = 0

.loop:
    mov dh, byte [rsi + rcx]    ; dh = src[i]
    mov byte [rdi + rcx], dh
    inc rcx                     ; i++
    test dh, dh                 ; test dh == '\0'
    jnz .loop                   ; if not null, continue loop

    ret
```
---

### **Key Changes**

1. **Explicit Control**:  
   - Replaced `lodsb` and `stosb` with explicit `mov` instructions:  
     - `mov dh, byte [rsi + rcx]` for loading.  
     - `mov byte [rdi + rcx], dh` for storing.  
   - This ensures that `rsi` and `rdi` are not modified unintentionally.  

2. **Removed Direction Flag Dependency**:  
   - Eliminated the need for `cld` by using explicit address calculations (`rsi + rcx`, `rdi + rcx`).  
   - This makes the function independent of the direction flag, ensuring consistent behavior.  

3. **Improved Debuggability**:  
   - By explicitly showing all memory operations, the function becomes easier to debug and trace in case of errors.  

4. **Register Isolation**:  
   - The final code ensures that only `dh` is used for temporary storage, avoiding any modifications to critical registers like `rsi` or `rdi`.  

---

### **Conclusion**

- The original code relied on implicit behavior (`lodsb` and `stosb`) and was dependent on the direction flag (`DF`), making it fragile and prone to bugs in nested contexts.  

- The final code resolves these issues by adopting explicit memory operations, removing direction flag dependency, and improving register isolation, resulting in a robust implementation suitable for broader use cases.
